                From 2016 to 2019, Ramsey portrayed Lyanna Mormont in the HBO fantasy drama television series Game of Thrones. The part is Ramsey's first credited role. After her debut appearance in "The Broken Man" (season 6, episode 7), fans and critics noted Ramsey was a standout actor for portraying her character's no-nonsense leadership style.[4][14] This reaction was repeated after her appearance in the season finale,[15] with The Hollywood Reporter calling her "season 6's breakout star".[16] Ramsey continued in the role for the series' seventh and eighth seasons.

Ramsey starred in the 2017 TV adaptation of The Worst Witch books, as the titular character Mildred Hubble,[4] for which she won the Young Performer award at the 2019 British Academy Children's Awards.[17] She announced on Instagram that she had left the series in 2020 due to mental health issues,[18] with her role being recast with Lydia Page for the fourth and final season.

Since 2018, Ramsey has voiced the title character in the 2018 Netflix original series Hilda, for which she won the 2019 BAFTA award for best "Children's Animation" along with Luke Pearson, Kurt Mueller, and Stephanie Simpson. The series marked the debut of Ramsey's singing talent, with her debut song "The Life of Hilda" released on 25 November 2020,[19] and later on 14 December 2020 along with the release of the show's second season.[20] She reprised the role of Hilda in the 80-minute movie special, Hilda and the Mountain King, which premiered on 30 December 2021.

                In an interview Ramsey said she would hypothetically tick “non-binary” if it were an option on a form. However, she added, “Being gendered isn’t something that I particularly like, but in terms of pronouns, I really couldn’t care less.”
